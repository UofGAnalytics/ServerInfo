# ServerInfo

This is a simple repo to give a summary of the resources presented in the servers at UoG Math and Stats servers session as part of PhD training. 

We strongly encourage those PhD students who go on to use this repo, to make Pull requests back on this repo to add additional information which can help other PhD students who may wish to use these servers.

The overall structure is as follow:

1. Slides - a overview of the servers
2. RServer&CommandlineScreen - A guide to using RServer and the Commandline
3. PureCommandLine - A guide to using pure commandline
4. Slurm - A guide to using our job scheduler.

## Command line use.

This repo and session is designed to give you a high level understanding of using servers in this department. If you do not have experience with this, we also strongly advise that you take a software carpentry course on using the linux shell:
